[EEP153]: Project 4 - Team Luther Burbank

# Project Goals:

We hope to address nutritional inadequacies in Ethiopia for potassium, folate, and calcium through targeted income transfers and technological innovation. We would like to find out how much compensation is required for the median household to meet adequate levels of these nutrients.

# About Luther Burbank:

Luther Burbank (1849-1926) transformed the food system through his pioneering work in plant breeding, developing more than 800 new varieties of fruits, vegetables, flowers, and grains. By experimenting with selective crossbreeding and grafting techniques, he created hardier, more productive, and more palatable crops that improved agricultural efficiency and food quality. Notable examples include the Russet Burbank potato, new varieties of plums, peaches, berries, and spineless cacti. His innovations helped increase crop yields, extend growing seasons, and diversify the food supply, laying the groundwork for modern agricultural practices. Burbank's work made it possible to grow food more reliably in different climates and soil conditions, supporting the expansion of farming into new regions. His legacy lives on in the widespread commercial use of his plant varieties and in the continued use of selective breeding to meet global food demands.
